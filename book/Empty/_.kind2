// Defines the Empty type, which has no constructors
// The Empty type (bottom type) represents impossibility
// It is used to:
// 1. Represent impossible cases in algebraic data types
// 2. Express constraints in type-level programming
// 3. Prove contradictions or show propositions are false
// Note: It's impossible to create a value of this type
