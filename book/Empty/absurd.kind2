/// Performs an absurd elimination on the Empty type.
///
/// This function allows us to derive any type from a value of the Empty type.
/// Since Empty has no constructors, it's impossible to create a value of this type.
/// Therefore, if we have a value of type Empty, we can conclude anything.
///
/// # Parameters
///
/// * `P` - The type we want to derive (can be any type).
///
/// # Inputs
///
/// * `e` - A value of type Empty (which cannot exist).
///
/// # Output
///
/// A value of type P.
///
/// # Note
///
/// This function is primarily used in proofs by contradiction or to handle
/// impossible cases in pattern matching.
